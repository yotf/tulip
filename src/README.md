##ScatterPanel
Scatter Panel is useful for multipath simulations, since only multipath simulation [ nesto iz onog rada njihovog ]. Also, because of the characteristiocs of multipath simulation (trying to minimize the number of lattice sweeps) there will be a few results that did not converge at all, and it is possible by laso selection to remove those obviously wrong results, and see the beatufiul normal distrubition we get without them. hooray8**!!!
